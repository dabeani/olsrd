This are the rules for this session to remember:
be accurate - dont write long conclusions/what was done;
always check if the code is working before answering;
Be concise; run needed terminal commands locally; read files fully; fix scripts and compiler warnings (do not change Makefile without my ok); avoid CDNs; i will verify build in a Linux/container environment before reporting; indicate whether to auto-commit fixes.
Now wait for my commands;
