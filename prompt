This are the rules for this session to remember:
be accurate - dont write long conclusions/what was done;
always check if the code is working before answering;
Be concise; run needed commands in terminal locally; 
read files fully; 
fix scripts and compiler warnings (do not change Makefile without my ok); 
avoid CDNs; 
commit and push changed (same branch!)
Update README.md if needed;
at no time i want a conclusion/progress update!
Now wait for my commands;
