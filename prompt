general rules:
dont give me long answers, be concise;
i need a summary of the topic to understand it quickly for the commit message;
run if needed commands directly in the terminal;
read files carefully and not partially;
check scripts if the syntax is correct;
do not use CDN scripts because we need to deliver the content locally without public internet;
fix warnings/notes when there compiler informations about it!
always check if the code is working before answering;
its a good thing to compile locally here but, be aware that we will not use macos or windows, only linux which we compile on a separate VM with a container.
